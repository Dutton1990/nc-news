## General info

This app was built by myself using React on the Northcoders bootcamp to supplement the back end project I created beforehand. 

### As a user, you can:

1. view a list of all articles
2. view a page for each topic with a list of related articles.
3. view an individual article.
4. view an individual article's comments.
5. vote on an article and immediately see the change.
6. post a new comment to an existing article (as a default logged in user. e.g. 'jessjelly').
7. sort articles by:
    date created
    comment_count
    votes

It also features error handling (including not being able to post a blank comment) and has a responsive design that alters based on screen size.
